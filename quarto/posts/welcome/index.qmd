This blog is under migration to quarto.

![](migration.png)

I initially used fastai's fastpages framework to run & expose jupyter notebooks as blog posts here. Unfortunately fastpages was discontinued a while ago and I got a bit fed up investigating & fixing github actions etc everytime I want to post an article. As suggested by the fastpages author, I'm thus discovering & migrating to quarto. which looks indeed very nice. 

While doing that i also noticed that the 3D rendering py3dmol library I was using doesn't work as well anymore - so will switch also gradually. 
So please do not be alarmed if you see dramatic changes in layout etc during the next days ;)

Most of the work was done by Mael Shorkar, an eager summer intern we took in at Discngine during last year's COVID-mess summer. He did a great job under these circumstances (remote work in a new company etc). So kudos to him for these new additions. \n\n## MMCIF support\n\nFirst of all, fpocket now supports mmCIF. Yay ... yet another very painful task to integrate for yet another painfully crappy molecular file format (I admire the openbabel folks ...  ;) ).  Same as for the PDB format we forked essentially an integration from the VMD molfile plugin and extended that a bit further. Mael also integrated mmCIF writers so all output files can be written in this new crappy format as well. Essentially you now have the choice to write either only pdb or cif or both. So everybody should be happy (nah ... that's never going to be case anyway). \n\n## New command line flags\n\nThe most interesting part (for me) of this release are additional command line flags and behind these several use cases that can be addressed now. These command line arguments enable mainly to work in a more controlled way with multi chain protein structures. This can be particularly useful if:\n1. you want to study only one domain of one of these novel gigantic cryoEM structures\n2. you want to study in detail a protein - biomolecule binding site (so other than small molecule)\n3. you want to learn key characteristics of peptide/protein binding sites vs RNA/DNA binding sites vs drug binding sites\n\n```\n    -c char : (Default is none): Use this flag to choose which chains you want to delete before running fpocket. The selected chains can be specified with ',' or ':' delimiters, for example you can use it '-c B,D' or '-c B:D'. You can delete up to 20 different chains.\n``` \nThis flag essentially allows you to explicitly delete particular chain(s) before doing the fpocket run. This allows you to identify (without any bias) clefts that might occur on the PPI that were inaccessible before for pocket prediction. \n\n```\n    -k char : (Default is none): Use this flag to choose which chains you want to keep before running fpocket. The selected chains can be specified with ',' or ':' delimiters, for example you can use it '-k A,B,E' or '-k A:B:E'. You can keep up to 20 different chains.\n```\nThis is essentially the inverse operator of the previous flag. If you do not want to list n chains, you can decide to keep only the relevant ones here. \n\n```\n    -a char : (Default is none): With this flag you can select a chain you want to be considered as a ligand. Works the same way as the \"-r\" flag but with a whole chain. Only a single chain can be chosen, for example '-a D'.\n```\n\nThis flag essentially allows you to target for only one particular binding epitope. If you want to extract descriptors for only that binding site where the select chain is located then you can use the `-a` flag. Fpocket will hide the chain specified via the flag. Run vertice detection and then will choose all vertices overlapping with the chain you specified in `-a`. These will then be clustered together into a final \"pocket\".  This is rather generic and can be applied on protein chains, RNA, DNA ... whatever you like given that it is defined in a seperate chain. It is so generic, that in theory you can do even very nasty stuff, but let's see if you can find that out yourselves.\n\nThis argument is particularly interesting when you want to extract examples (3D patches) or numerical descriptors (polar/apolar ASA, curvature, buriedness ...) for other binding sites than classical small molecule binding sites. It essentially lies out the basics for training & learning what such other binding epitopes look like. You can use that for a fancy model, or to characterize binding epitopes ultimately. \n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nSeperately, several things were added to the [github repo of fpocket](https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket), namely the old documentation was ported to markdown (that was painful).\nThere's also a tiny testing environment, CI/CD pipes finally set up to check compilation and unit tests upon PR's. \n\nLast, an official fpocket docker image is also available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fpocket/fpocket/). \n\n# Detecting binding epitopes \n\nEnough text now. Let's check what you can do with that now. Here we have a nice example of a [TEAD4 / YAP complex](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6HIK). I'm interested in studying the clefts covered by YAP on the TEAD4 structure. Before I essentially had to drop YAP from the PDB run fpocket and put back in YAP to see where it is located. Here YAP corresponds to chain L (the red one) and TEAD4 (the grey one).\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\n// Create drawing area\ndivNGL = html`<div style=\"width:800px;height:600px;position:relative\"></div>`;\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\n//| output: false\n//| echo: false\nNGL = require(\"ngl@next\");\n// Create trajectory object\nstage = new NGL.Stage(divNGL, { backgroundColor: \"black\",cameraType: \"orthographic\"});\npdbString = await FileAttachment(\"6hik.pdb\").blob();\nstructure = await stage.loadFile(pdbString, {ext: \"pdb\", asTrajectory: false})\nstructure.addRepresentation(\"cartoon\",{ \"sele\": \":L\", \"color\": \"red\"});\nstructure.addRepresentation(\"cartoon\",{ \"sele\": \":A\", \"color\": \"grey\"});\nstructure.autoView();\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now for instance launch fpocket on TEAD4 by either dropping YAP or by keeping TEAD4 explicitly. Whatever mindset you prefer ;) Let's be in a positive mood and keep TEAD4: \n```\nfpocket -f 6hik.pdb -k A\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\n// Create drawing area\ndivNGL2 = html`<div style=\"width:800px;height:600px;position:relative\"></div>`;\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\n//| output: false\n//| echo: false\n// Create trajectory object\nstage2 = new NGL.Stage(divNGL2, { backgroundColor: \"black\",cameraType: \"orthographic\"});\npdbString2 = await FileAttachment(\"6hik_out.pdb\").blob();\nstructure2 = await stage2.loadFile(pdbString2, {ext: \"pdb\", asTrajectory: false})\nstructure2.addRepresentation(\"cartoon\",{ \"sele\": \":L\", \"color\": \"red\"});\nstructure2.addRepresentation(\"cartoon\",{ \"sele\": \":A\", \"color\": \"grey\"});\nstructure2.addRepresentation(\"hyperball\",{ \"sele\": \":C\",\"colorScheme\":\"residueindex\"});\nstructure2.autoView();\n```\n\n\n\n\nWhen doing this in an automatic way, so with classical fpocket parameters, you'll now be able to identify pockets that overlap with YAP. That's kind of nice, but what if I want to study really in detail all the binding interface itself between YAP and TEAD4?\nIn order to instruct fpocket to define a pocket only on the interface itself you can now do something like that: \n\n```bash\nfpocket -f 6hik.pdb -a L\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\n// Create drawing area\ndivNGL3 = html`<div style=\"width:800px;height:600px;position:relative\"></div>`;\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\n//| output: false\n//| echo: false\n// Create trajectory object\nstage3 = new NGL.Stage(divNGL3, { backgroundColor: \"black\",cameraType: \"orthographic\"});\npdbString3 = await FileAttachment(\"6hik_out_explicit.pdb\").blob();\nstructure3 = await stage3.loadFile(pdbString3, {ext: \"pdb\", asTrajectory: false})\nstructure3.addRepresentation(\"cartoon\",{ \"sele\": \":L\", \"color\": \"red\"});\nstructure3.addRepresentation(\"cartoon\",{ \"sele\": \":A\", \"color\": \"grey\"});\nstructure3.addRepresentation(\"hyperball\",{ \"sele\": \":C\",'color':\"orange\"});\nstructure3.autoView();\n```\n\n\nYou can now get the full orange blob as the interacting epitope. Together with that you get the usual statistics etc. The cool thing is, this can be very well used on protein RNA interfaces as well. \n\n### A word on druggability\n\nIf you want to assess druggability, please use the default fpocket parameters and not a guided pocket detection or other pocket detection parameters. The druggability assessment intends to estimate a pockets tractability for small molecule binding sites. Applying this to such larger surfaces is out of the applicability domain here in my opinion. \n\n\n## Extracting descriptors with fpocket\n\nOk running these things on individual examples is nice. You can automate things with fpocket quite easily and extract descriptors on a larger scale using the fancy `-d` flag (oh yes, yet another flag) if the only thing you're after is descriptor extraction. \n\n### Why would I ever want to extract descriptors?\n\nCalculating descriptors on binding epitopes is generating the basis for using these to derive several potential applications afterwards. For instance, to derive the druggability prediction in fpocket, first we extracted descriptors of known druggable and supposed non-druggable (no religious debate here) pockets, second we determined the most relevant descriptors and last we trained a scoring function based on these descriptors. \n\nYou can very well imagine to do the same on other types of binding epitopes (there are a few papers out there on that already I guess), like protein protein interfaces, antibody / antigene interfaces more specifically, crystal contacts, protein DNA/RNA interfaces etc...\n\nUltimately these characterisations will allow you to train functions or super fancy __deep__ learning models (if you really need that). \n\nIn order to do that on a larger scale you could use dpocket (a less well-known sibling of fpocket), but it currently still doesn't fully integrate the logic with selecting chains as ligands (still a bit of work needed here). So let's stick to fpocket on a larger scale example for descriptor extraction which will work just fine: \n\n\n```\ndata/peptide_data/3uqp.pdb B\ndata/peptide_data/3uri.pdb B\ndata/peptide_data/4rcp.pdb B\ndata/peptide_data/4tpg.pdb E\ndata/peptide_data/5jxh.pdb H\n```\n\nLet's suppose we have a csv file like this one above. It defines a set of PDB files and the chain we want to consider as a ligand explicitly during the fpocket run to assess the binding epitope this chain is making with the \"receptor\". You could run this in a very geeky way using this here: \n\n`awk '{ print \"fpocket -f \" $1 \" -a \"$2 \" -d\"}' list.txt` | sh\n\nThis will output a messy thing like this: \n```csv\ncav_id

I'm a European citizen, currently stranded in France. I did my PhD in Xavier Barril's excellent group at the University of Barcelona, then a post-doc in molecular modelling within a French pharma company. However, I spent most of my "professional career" at [Discngine](https://www.discngine.com) based in Paris, France. 

I'll likely write about whatever crosses my mind here, but it'll surely focus on topics around cheminformatics, bioinformatics, binding sites, maybe a few papers. Let's see where this goes.
